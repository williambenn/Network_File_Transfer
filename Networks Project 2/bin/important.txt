Hi whatevany,

The reason you are getting these errors is because in your class RoomDimension you have defined other constructors that take parameters but have not added a constructor which takes no parameters. You get a default constructor for every class you define by default UNLESS you define other constructors. Then you have to define the parameterless constructors yourself.

So for each of your classes, you must add an empty parameterless constructor. That or when you go to initialize your class, give them the parameters the class requires.

The error is telling you that it is attempting to find this parameterless constructor and can't find it because you haven't defined it. If you hadn't defined your own constructors it would have made a parameterless one by default and there would be no problems. 

You have also attempted to create an instance of CarpetCost which is not a class you have defined there. Didn't you mean to create a class of RoomCarpet? Carpetcost is a variable of the RoomCarpet class. You can't create an instance of carpetcost. It is just a variable of the other class.
